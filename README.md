# Space Demo

A simple demo version of a kind of space game, made with C using [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and [Raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui).

Developed and tested on (GNU) Linux, but should work on Windows as well with the appropriate libraries.

## The purpose of this project

The project is, in the first place, not meant to be a full-featured game. It is a demo, and will probably remain a demo for the forseeable future.

The reason to write this, then, is as a learning experience, to gain more experience with the C language. And, of course, just for fun as well.

While meant as just a test/learning project, it is shared here, in case anybody is interested. Either in the project itself, or in my programming.

## Drawbacks

As a demo, the project is severely limited in various aspects.

The enemy AI is not what it could be. They keep crashing into asteroids. The movement could be improved. The score could be improved. The visuals could be improved.

However, through all that, the code is fairly structured, and can be built upon in the future, if desired.

As a demonstration project, I believe it fits its given role decently well.
